		Game of Trees (Got) is a version control system which prioritizes ease
		of use and simplicity over flexibility. Got uses Git repositories to
		store versioned data. Git can be used for any functionality which has
		not yet been implemented in Got. It will always remain possible to work
		with both Got and Git on the same repository.
